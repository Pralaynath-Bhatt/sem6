I know we joke around a lot and it’s always fun.
But if I’m being real with you for once...
all this time I’ve been talking about this crush — it’s always been you.
And I didn’t say it earlier 'cause I was scared it might mess up what we have.
But I couldn’t keep pretending anymore.
I’m not saying this to make things awkward. I just had to be honest with you.
You mean a lot to me.
